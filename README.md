# grocery-list built in Vue.js

I built this to demo Vue as a Frontend solution. This was my first time using this framework but I can say the build was intuitive and fast. Being a huge fan of React, I see the similarities between the two, but they still pretty different. I can say using $emit() to bubble up data is a neat solution to component communication. All-in-all, I'm curious how many will adopt this and how long it will be around for, but I can say for me, I wouldn't mind working with this framework again.
